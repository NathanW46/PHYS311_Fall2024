    "* Now that you have the eigenvectors, you can express your system in a coordinate system defined by these three eigenvectors. Calculate the representation of the second particle position in this new coordinate system. (Remember that the $x^\\prime$ value of a vector $\\vec{v}$ will just be $\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{x}^{\\prime}$.) You should have new descriptions of the two particle positions in this new basis.\n",
